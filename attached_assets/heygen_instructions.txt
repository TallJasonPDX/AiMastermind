From what I see in HeyGen's Streaming API v2 Integration with LiveKit guide, it does not explicitly mention setting a background image dynamically through the API. Instead, the background is typically controlled through HeyGen's scene settings, meaning:

Pre-configured Scene (Template Approach)

You may need to set the background within the HeyGen platform by creating a scene/template that already includes the desired background.
When you initiate a streaming session, you specify this template ID so that the avatar appears with that background.
Dynamic Background Control (Possible Workaround?)

If the API allows for live overlays or layers, you could potentially superimpose a background using CSS or video compositing techniques (e.g., placing a static or video background behind the iframe displaying the LiveKit stream).
Another possibility is using a green-screen template in HeyGen, then chroma-keying out the background and replacing it dynamically.
If you're aiming for a fully dynamic background swap at runtime, the best approach would be to:

Check if HeyGenâ€™s API supports passing a background parameter when starting a session.
If not, create multiple pre-set templates with different backgrounds in HeyGen and call the appropriate template ID dynamically.
If a green-screen option exists, you can key it out and overlay a separate background programmatically.
Would you like me to check if their API has a hidden way to set the background dynamically?

I have a template ID, how do I implement it?

If you have a template ID from HeyGen, you need to pass it when initializing the Streaming API session. Here's how you can implement it:

Steps to Use a Template in HeyGen's Streaming API
Set Up Your HeyGen API Request
When you send the POST request to start a session, you include the template_id in the body.

Example API Request

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "template_id": "your-template-id",
  "voice_id": "your-voice-id",
  "text": "Hello, this is a test",
  "livekit_room": "your-room-id",
  "livekit_identity": "your-identity"
}
Replace "your-template-id" with the actual template ID you got from HeyGen.
"your-voice-id" refers to the AI voice you want to use.
"your-room-id" should be the LiveKit room where the avatar will stream.
"your-identity" is a unique user identifier for LiveKit.
Send the Request to HeyGenâ€™s Streaming API Make a POST request to:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://api.heygen.com/v2/streaming/sessions
Example in Python using requests:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

API_KEY = "your-api-key"
TEMPLATE_ID = "your-template-id"
VOICE_ID = "your-voice-id"
ROOM_ID = "your-room-id"
USER_ID = "your-identity"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "template_id": TEMPLATE_ID,
    "voice_id": VOICE_ID,
    "text": "Hello, this is a test message",
    "livekit_room": ROOM_ID,
    "livekit_identity": USER_ID
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.heygen.com/v2/streaming/sessions",
    headers=headers,
    json=data
)

print(response.json())  # This will return the streaming session info
LiveKit Integration

Once the session starts, LiveKit provides a real-time video stream of the avatar using your selected template.
Youâ€™ll need a LiveKit SDK implementation on the front end (React, Vue, or Vanilla JS) to display the streaming video.
How Do You Confirm the Template Is Used?
After making the request, HeyGen should return a session response that includes:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "session_id": "12345",
  "status": "started",
  "stream_url": "wss://your-stream-url"
}
Open the LiveKit streaming URL in a browser to see if the background matches your template.
What If the Background Doesnâ€™t Change?
Ensure the template itself includes the correct background in HeyGen.
Double-check if HeyGenâ€™s API accepts dynamic background changes (they might restrict changes after session start).
Let me know if you need help integrating this into LiveKit or debugging API responses! ðŸš€
